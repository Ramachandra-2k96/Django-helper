# Django Helper  üöÄ

Django Helper is a tool to assist with Django project tasks. Follow the instructions below to get started.
By completing this procedure you will be able to use this utility on any terminal in your system. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Setup in Windows

1. **Include Main Python Script:**
   - Check whether the python script path is available in your system environmental variables.
   - If it is not there then add the path to your main Python script to the environmental variables.

2. **Clone the Project:**
   - Navigate to the desired location and clone the Django Helper project:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Ramachandra-2k96/Django-helper.git
     ```

3. **Copy Files:**
   - Copy the two required files from the cloned project to the `Scripts` folder:
     - django_helper.bat
     - django_helper.py

4. **Update Path in Bat File:**
   - Open the bat file (assuming it's named `django-helper.bat`) and update the path to Django Helper:** (The location of bat python file will be different for you) **
     ```bat
     python C:\Users\ramac\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts\django_helper.py
     ```

5. **Execute Module:**
   - Open any terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     django-helper.bat
     ```
   - If you think that this command is too large you can rename the file to ** help_dj.bat ** or ** help_dj ** so that it will be easy to call and remember

## üêß Usage and Setup in Linux
1. **Check if Python is installed**: Some Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is already installed by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, you'll see a message indicating that the command was not found.

2. **Install Python**: If Python is not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. The package manager varies depending on the Linux distribution you're using:

   - **Debian/Ubuntu**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3
     ```

   - **Fedora**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install python3
     ```

   - **CentOS/RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install python3
     ```

   - **Arch Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S python
     ```

3. **Verify installation**: After installation, verify that Python was installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   This should display the version number of the Python interpreter you just installed.
4. **Clone the Project:**
   - Navigate to the desired location and clone the Django Helper project:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Ramachandra-2k96/Django-helper.git
     ```
5. Create a script named `help_dj`:(Location of file will be different for you)
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   python /home/user/Desktop/Django-helper.py
   ```
6. Save the script to `/usr/local/bin`:(By default most of the users system have this)
   ```bash
   sudo mv help_dj /usr/local/bin
   ```
7. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/help_dj
   ```
8. Now, you can run `help_dj` from any directory in the terminal:
 - Navigate to deisred location in terminal where you want to create your project and try the commands 
   ```bash
   help_dj
   ```
